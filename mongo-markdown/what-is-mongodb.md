# What is MongoDb and its uses

Mongo DB is a No sql Database, it

- Does not store records in the form of tables
- Collection is a Json file similar to tables of SQL
- Documents is each individual Object in the Json
- All the JSON objects need not have the same schema/Structure
- Efficient when dealing with transactional data
- Highly scalable as data can be divided among different mongo servers.
- No need of transforming the data to JSON after querying as Json is the preferred o/p format
- internally uses binary Json / bson.
