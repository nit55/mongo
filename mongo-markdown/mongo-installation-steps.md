# Installation of Mongo DB on windows

- download the mongo installer from the following link
- https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server
- Install the above download using the installer.
- Create a folder called /data/db in the root folder or the C:/ drive.
- windows installs Mongo as a service so start and stop Mongo manually
  - open command prompt as administrator
  - run the command net stop mongoDB
  - this makes sure that mongo does not start automatically and we set the path for mongo.
- To run Mongo as in Mac/Linux we need to update the path variables
  - search for environment by pressing windows icon
  - Environment variables button will appear in the bottom right, click on it
  - double click on "Path"
  - add the path to the installed folder as such `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin` and save it
- close all terminals and open a new terminal
- type in mongo and now the installed version will be seen.
- type in mongod --dbpath 'path to the data/db/ folder creted in root', needs to be set only once.
- Keep this terminal running and minimize it, this is the running server.
- open a new terminal and type on mongo.
- MongoDB has now started.
