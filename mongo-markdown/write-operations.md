## insertOne(data,options)

- To insert one Object/Document use insertOne()

```js
db.passengers.insertOne({ name: "nitin", age: 31 });
```

- once inserted successfully the following response will be shown

```js
{
    "acknowledged" : true,
    "insertedId" : ObjectId("62a05ad28687c579c875")
}
```

- ID's are auto generated by MongoDB, however custom ID's can be given using \_id but make sure the ID gicen is unique

```js
db.flightData.insertOne({
  arrival: "10:30",
  departure: "2:30",
  _id: "plane-1",
});
```

- The output would be as follows

```js
{ "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : "plane-1" }
```

- as seen from the output above the document is inserted with the custom ID.

## insertMany(data,options)

- To insert Multiple Objects use insertMany(), it accepts an array.

```js
db.passengers.insertMany([
  { name: "prasan", age: 30 },
  { name: "Lakshmi", age: 29 },
]);
```

- The output for insertMany() would be as below

```js
{
        "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedIds" : [
                ObjectId("62a05d0c8687c579c875e"),
                ObjectId("62a05d0c8687c579c875e")
        ]
}
```

- as seen from the output the id's are auto-generated for each document, custom ID's can also be passed for each document as seen above.
